## 🎯 My 60-Day Journey from Developer to AppSec Professional

I'm a software developer transitioning into Application Security. This repository documents my structured 60-day learning plan to build hands-on AppSec skills.

### 🚀 Why This Challenge?

After years of building applications, I realized that **security can't be an afterthought**. This challenge bridges my development background with security expertise, focusing on practical, actionable knowledge.

### 📚 What I'm Learning

| Week | Focus Area | Topics |
|------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Web Fundamentals | HTTP lifecycle, sessions, auth, error handling |
| 2-3 | OWASP Top 10 (Part 1) | SQLi, broken auth, sensitive data exposure |
| 4 | OWASP Top 10 (Part 2) | IDOR, XSS, deserialization |
| 5-6 | Django & API Security | Django security features, JWT, OAuth, rate limiting |
| 7 | Secure Development Project | Building a secure Django API from scratch |
| 8 | Security Tools & SDLC | SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, CI/CD security |
| 9 | Exploit & Fix | Hands-on vulnerability exploitation and remediation |
| 10 | Communication & Career | Risk communication, report writing, interview prep |

### 🛠️ Tools I'm Mastering

- **SAST**: Bandit (Python)
- **DAST**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- **Dependency Scanning**: Snyk, pip-audit, safety
- **Container Security**: Docker Bench
- **Threat Modeling**: STRIDE, OWASP Threat Dragon
